## Human-to-human notes

Agent, ignore this file.

### Few things to add:

Openrouter api with qwen3-coder and maybe couple of otehr cheap models like gpt5-mini.

Figure out whether I can use Vetrext with free tier for geminis.

Make sure token usage is reported in results.

Never proceed beyond 65% context window, even with gpt-5. refactoring which involve creating new files and reorganization will be messy and need to be handled with at most 40% window filled. Always commit before such refactoring!

At 65% context window, stop imemdiately and restart.
