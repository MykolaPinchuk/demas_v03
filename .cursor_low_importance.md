This file lists low-importance files and directories that agents should avoid reading unless they know exactly why.

- BENCHMARKS.md  # read only when working on benchmarks or summarizing model results
- docs/           # read only for high-level orientation; not needed for coding tasks
- sandbox/swe_official.jsonl  # used by adapter fallback; keep but skip unless running official tasks
- demas/core/models.py  # only relevant when updating model registry or sweep defaults

Note: sandbox outputs and caches are already excluded via .cursorignore.
