## General guidelines for agent

- Do not over-engineer.
- Use rapid iterative development. Make one change, validate, then proceed. Keep iterations small to minimize risk and make progress smooth.
- Human user is a Data Scientist with a very limited SWE background. Not very bright. Communicate accordingly.
- Ask questions if unsure. Do not ask questions about low-level SWE details.
- Always keep in mind big picture. Do not lose forest for trees. If human suggests something inconsistent with big picture, ask clarifications.
- Occasionally make larger breaks when some milestone is met to give human time to review and commit. 
- Keep .gitignore up to date. Except for that, do not touch git. Human will handle git workflow.
- Be honest. If unsure, say unsure. No bullshitting.
- Human is pretty dumb. Sometimes his demands make no sense. Be ready to push back and explain things further. Human is aware of this and fine with pushback.
